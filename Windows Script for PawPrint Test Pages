::Windows batch file used to print multiple test pages using a local printer
::by first mapping a network printer to a local port.

::Make sure the selected printer is shared on the network before executing
::this script.

::Make sure the test file is a txt file saved to the same default PWD as this 
::executable and named test.txt before executing this script.

::Save this text file as a cmd file and send it to the desktop for easy access.
::Make sure the script file and the test file are in the same directory.

::Make sure the PawPrint UNI-client is downloaded on the user's account.

::Make sure the name of the current Windows user's name is identical to the UNI 
::associated with the PawPrint queue.
